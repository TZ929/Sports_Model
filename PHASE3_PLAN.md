# Phase 3: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

## 🎯 **Phase 3 Objectives**

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, data type conversions
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data quality and consistency
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from different sources (teams, players, games, stats)
- **Data Normalization**: Scale features appropriately for modeling

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Player Performance Features**: Rolling averages, trends, season stats
- **Game Context Features**: Home/away, back-to-back, rest days
- **Team Performance Features**: Team strength, recent form
- **Matchup Features**: Head-to-head history, defensive ratings
- **Time-based Features**: Season progression, game timing

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Player Performance Analysis**: Identify key performance indicators
- **Trend Analysis**: Seasonal patterns, recent form
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between features
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual performances

### 4. Model Preparation
- **Feature Selection**: Choose most predictive features
- **Data Splitting**: Train/validation/test splits
- **Target Variable Definition**: Define prop bet outcomes
- **Baseline Models**: Simple statistical models

## 📊 **Current Data Inventory**

### Available Data
- **Teams**: 39 NBA teams with IDs and names
- **Players**: 107 players with ESPN IDs and names
- **Games**: 55 games with team relationships and scores
- **Player Stats**: 11+ game statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.)
