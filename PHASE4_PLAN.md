# Phase 4: Prediction Pipeline and Deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 4 Objectives**

### 1. Prediction Pipeline
- **Create a prediction script**: This script will take upcoming game information as input and generate predictions using the trained model.
- **Integrate Data Collection**: The pipeline should automatically fetch the latest player and team stats required for feature engineering.
- **Automate Feature Engineering**: Apply the same feature engineering steps used for training to the new data.

### 2. Model Serving (Optional)
- **Develop a REST API**: Create a simple web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to expose the prediction functionality.
- **Define API Endpoints**: Specify endpoints for getting predictions for a given game.

### 3. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Incorporate Betting Odds**: Investigate and integrate betting odds from sportsbooks as features in the model.
- **Explore New Feature Sources**: Research and identify other potential data sources that could improve model accuracy.

### 4. Code Refactoring and Productionization
- **Modularize Code**: Refactor the existing codebase to improve modularity and reusability.
- **Enhance Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the pipeline.
- **Write Unit and Integration Tests**: Develop a suite of tests to ensure the reliability of the data processing and prediction pipeline.

## ðŸ›  **Implementation Plan**

### Step 1: Prediction Pipeline Development
- [ ] Create `predict.py` script.
- [ ] Load the trained LightGBM model.
- [ ] Implement functions to fetch data for a specific game.
- [ ] Apply feature engineering to the new data.
- [ ] Generate and output the prediction.

### Step 2: Betting Odds Integration
- [ ] Analyze the `sportsbook_scraper.py` file.
- [ ] Develop a strategy to collect and integrate betting odds.
- [ ] Retrain the model with the new odds-based features.
- [ ] Evaluate the impact of these new features on model performance.

### Step 3: API Development (Optional)
- [ ] Set up a basic Flask/FastAPI application.
- [ ] Create an endpoint that accepts game data.
- [ ] Call the prediction pipeline from the API.
- [ ] Return the prediction as a JSON response.

### Step 4: Refactoring and Testing
- [ ] Review and refactor `src` directory for better organization.
- [ ] Add logging to key components.
- [ ] Develop and run tests for the prediction pipeline.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Begin development of the `predict.py` script.**
2. **Investigate the sportsbook data collection.**
3. **Outline the structure of the prediction API.**

**Ready to begin Phase 4 implementation!**
