# Phase 2 Status: Data Acquisition and Storage

## ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Database Schema
- ✅ Teams table with proper relationships
- ✅ Players table (structure ready)
- ✅ Games table with team relationships
- ✅ Player game stats table
- ✅ Prop odds table
- ✅ Model predictions table
- ✅ Bet recommendations table

### Data Collection
- ✅ **Teams**: 30 NBA teams collected and stored
- ✅ **Games**: 54 games collected with proper team ID mapping
- ✅ **Basic Data Pipeline**: Working end-to-end data collection

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Database connection and session management
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Logging system
- ✅ Error handling

## ❌ **ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### Player Data Collection
- ❌ Player ID extraction not working correctly (getting BR_1, BR_2 instead of jamesle01, curryst01)
- ❌ Player statistics collection failing due to incorrect player IDs
- ❌ Need to find correct Basketball Reference table structure or alternative data source

## 🚀 **PHASE 2 COMPLETION OPTIONS**

### Option 1: Fix Player Extraction (Recommended)
- Investigate Basketball Reference page structure more thoroughly
- Try different URLs or table IDs for player statistics
- Consider using NBA API as fallback for player data

### Option 2: Move to Phase 3 with Current Data
- Use teams and games data (which are working well)
- Focus on feature engineering and model development
- Add player data later when source is identified

### Option 3: Use Alternative Data Source
- Switch to NBA API for player data
- Use ESPN or other sports APIs
- Create synthetic player data for testing

## 📊 **CURRENT DATA SUMMARY**

```
Teams: 30 ✅
Games: 54 ✅ (with proper team relationships)
Players: 574 ❌ (incorrect IDs)
Player Stats: 0 ❌
```

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Phase 2 is 80% complete** with teams and games working perfectly. The core data structure and pipeline are solid.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Option A**: Spend more time debugging player extraction
2. **Option B**: Move to Phase 3 and add player data later
3. **Option C**: Use NBA API for player data

**Recommendation**: Move to Phase 3 (data preprocessing and feature engineering) since we have the core infrastructure working. Player data can be added incrementally.
